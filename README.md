## Notes about provenance

I removed references to third-party editors/tools from this README. I will not assist with altering git history or falsifying commit authorship. If you want to make the project clearly authored by you, a safe approach is to:

- Add an AUTHOR or CONTRIBUTORS file listing yourself.
- Make new commits using your name and email (configured in git) going forward.
- Add a `NOTICE` or `ABOUT` file describing ownership.

If you'd like, I can (a) update CONTRIBUTING / AUTHOR metadata, (b) help add a simple contributors section, or (c) prepare a short AUTHORS file for you to include.
